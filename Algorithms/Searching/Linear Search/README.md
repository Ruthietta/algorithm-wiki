## Description

Linear Search is a simple search algorithm that sequentially checks each element in a list until the target value is found or all elements have been checked.

## Algorithm

The Linear Search algorithm works as follows:

1. Iterate through each element in the array.
2. Compare each element with the target value.
3. If a match is found, return the index of the element.
4. If the target value is not found after iterating through the entire array, return -1.
