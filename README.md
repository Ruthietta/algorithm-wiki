## About the project

After taking my algorithm uni class I started to take interest in that topic. While studying I got into some issues, which I would like to sort out with this repository:
 * trouble in finding usage for those algorithms in practice,
 * difficulty in understanding more complex algorithms,
 * wasting time on searching or asking ChatGPT to find best ways to implement algorithms.

And those issues I'd like to get resolved by features below.
