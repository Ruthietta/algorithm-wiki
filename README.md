## About the Project

After taking my algorithm class at university, I developed a deep interest in the subject. While studying, I encountered challenges such as:
- Trouble finding practical applications for algorithms.
- Difficulty understanding more complex algorithms.
- Wasting time searching for the best ways to implement algorithms.

This repository aims to resolve these issues by providing:
- Practical implementations of algorithms.
- Simplified explanations and visualizations for better understanding.
- A centralized, community-driven hub for algorithmic knowledge.
